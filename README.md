## Project Journey & Challenges

Building SmartChat was an exciting journey filled with learning and problem-solving. Early on, we encountered complex issues such as the infamous `path-to-regexp` error that required deep debugging to resolve routing conflicts. Additionally, CORS blockades posed challenges in secure API communication between the frontend and backend. Overcoming these hurdles was crucial in creating a robust, secure, and seamless full-stack application. These experiences strengthened the architecture and improved the overall user experience.
